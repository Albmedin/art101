		 <h2>Lab Subject</h2>
     <p>This lab was about learning the basics of html and creating your own website.</p>

		 <h2>Journey Difficulties</h2>
		 <p>My partner was more experienced than I am in web designing and coding in general so I was mostly guided by him when I had difficulties such as referencing images in the index and in the css page.</p>

     <h2>Results</h2>
		 <p>Throughout the process of the lab, I was able to sucessfully create a website and became more comfortable editing it with html and the css page. My css page could still use some work, and there plenty of things I would want to learn how to add to make my website more appealing to the eye.</p>
